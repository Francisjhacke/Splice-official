SPLICE, the latest hard rock sensation out of Oshawa, ON, are quickly making headlines after their debut live performances. With their upcoming EP being prepared for release, the eyes of Ontario will surely be drawn towards this continually-conceptual merger of hard rock, metal, and French/Indigenous culture. This is a band that needs to be seen to be believed.

When a band is able to provide a level of energy so high that an entire room of onlookers are captivated from the second the show starts until the moment it ends, it is clear that said band must be doing something right. From on-stage antics to memorable off-stage encounters, the level of fan enthusiasm is already staggering for such a young band. Formed in the months of late 2017, SPLICE cleverly transformed their material into a work of art, crafting an expressive and inventive take on the modern rock genre. Though influenced by a combination of culture and game-changing artists of the past such as MUDHONEY, SYSTEM OF A DOWN, and NIRVANA, it would be impossible to deny the level of originality SPLICE have worked into their sound.

From guitarist and vocalist PHILIPPE RACETTE's opening scream in crowd-pleaser “HONEY”, to drummer AUSTIN GAUVIN's pounding rhythm in “ELEPHANTASIA”, it is apparent that the material has been delicately hand-crafted and fine-tuned to perfection. Lead guitarist JUAN MENDEZ puts forward some of his most impressive guitar work in tracks like “BIPOLAR”, while the opening riffs of “VEINDUZE” and bassist KODY PELLETIER's own “SMOKE” demonstrate that the band were truly born to perform. Especially after having a stand-out performance to 300 attendees at Toronto's Opera House, SPLICE effectively confirmed this.
